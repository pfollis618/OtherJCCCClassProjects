            <p>Fionn mac Cumhaill is a hero from the Fenian Cycle of Irish Mythology. He was the leader of a band of legendary warriors called the Fianna and he has multiple interesting myths about him.</p>

        <h2>Fionn mac Cumhaill’s Origin’s</h2>
            <p>Fionn mac Cumhaill’s story starts with his father, Cumhall who was the leader of the Fianna. He fell in love with Miurne, who was the daughter of a powerful druid whose name was Tadhag. Tadhag rejects Cumhall when he comes to court Miurne as Tadhag had learned through his abilities that Cumhall would be his downfall. Cumhall then proceeds to kidnap Miurne, which starts a war between the Fianna and the High King of Ireland as Tadhag asked for the High King’s help. During the battle, Cumhall is killed by a man named Goll mac Morna. However, after the war was over, it was revealed that Miurne was pregnant. Because of this, Tadhag rejects her and wants her to be burned. Luckily, the High King rejects that idea and proceeds to put Miurne under his protection to make sure that doesn’t happen. After she gave birth, Muirne gave her son, who she named Demne, to his aunt Bodhmall and her companion Liath Luachra to raise. The two raised him in secret in the forest of Sliabh Bladhma to prevent his father’s enemies from coming after him. Bodhmall and Liath Luachra taught Demne everything they knew which helped him to become a great warrior.</p>
            <p>When he was older, Demne started to work under many different kings who were able to figure out that he was the son of Cumhall even though Demne didn’t tell anyone. People started to call him Fionn, which means light haired, since he wouldn’t tell them his name. This is why he’s known as Fionn mac Cumhaill, with mac Cumhaill meaning ‘son of Cumhall’.</p>
        <h2>The Salmon of Knowledge</h2>
            <p>On his travels, Fionn meets a fisherman named Finneas. Finneas had spent seven years trying to catch the Salmon of Knowledge in the hopes that he could get a lot of knowledge and wisdom by eating it. Soon after Fionn arrives, the Salmon of Knowledge gets caught by Finneas. As Finneas is cooking the salmon of Knowledge, he needed to head out to do something so he asked Fionn to keep an eye on the fish as it cooked and to not eat any of it. However, while Fionn was tending to the fish, a bit of hot grease from it landed on his thumb which caused him to put his thumb in his mouth to cool it off. This counted as eating part of the fish and so Finneas let Fionn eat the rest of the salmon. Because of this, Fionn gained a lot of knowledge and wisdom, but only when he was sucking his thumb.</p>

        <h2>Aillén The Burner</h2>
            <p>Afterwards, Fionn went to the High King, who was different from the one who fought the Fianna, to try to join the Fianna. However, the current leader of the Fianna was Goll, the man who killed Fionn’s dad, who didn’t want Fionn to join. Fionn was given a chance to prove himself by stopping Aillén The Burner, who was a Fae prince who on every Samhain for the past 20 years would put everyone in the High King’s stronghold to sleep and then burn the roof off. To help with his fight, Fionn used a magic spear he inherited from his father to stab himself in the face while Aillén was putting everyone to sleep so that he could stay awake. Fionn then fought Aillén and was able to kill him. This got him the respect of both the High King and the Fianna, with Goll stepping down as the Fianna’s leader and making Fionn the new leader. Tadhag also gives Fionn his house which fulfilled the prophecy he was trying to avoid by rejecting Cumhall.</p>

        <h2>Fionn mac Cumhaill and his Wife</h2>
            <p>One day, while Fionn was out hunting, he came across this deer that his hunting hounds wouldn’t let him kill. So, Fionn brought the deer back to his house and once it had entered his house it turned into a woman. The woman explained that her name was Sadhbh and that she had been turned into a deer by Fer Doirich(whose name means ‘dark man’), who was an evil member of the Tuatha Dé Danann, with Fionn’s house turning her back to human. After some time, Fionn and Sadhbh get married and Sadhbh gets pregnant. However, one day while Fionn is out with the Fianna, Sadhbh is lured out of the house by Fer Doirich who turns her back into a deer. When Fionn returns home, he searches the forest looking for Sadhbh, but he never finds her. After seven years, Fionn finds a boy in the forest that has a lot of resemblance to his wife and realizes that this is their son, so he takes the boy home and names him Oisín. After Oisín becomes an adult, he ends up joining the Fianna.</p> 
            <br/>
            <p>It is said in the myth that Fionn and the Fianna are sleeping in a cave in Ireland and that if the hunting horn of the Fianna is sounded three times, they’ll awaken and defend Ireland in its hour of need.</p>
