            <p>Kelpies are shape-shifting spirits that typically take the form of a horse that live in rivers and lakes according to myth. Stories about kelpies can be found in both Scotland and Ireland with similar stories being found in other Celtic nations like the Cabbyl-ushtey from the Isle of Man and the Ceffyl Dŵr from Wales. The name ‘kelpie’ most likely comes from the Scottish Gaelic words that mean heifer or colt.</p>

            <p>While the form that kelpies typically take is of a black horse, in some stories they are known to take the form of a human. While they may look nice, these water spirits are very malevolent and are known for drowning their victims in the bodies of water they reside by. They also love to eat human liver according to some stories. It is said that once a person mounts a kelpie, they will never be able to dismount due to both the kelpie’s extremely sticky hide and the kelpie's mane wrapping around its victim’s arms. According to legend, the favorite target of kelpies is children, though they are known to target anyone. When they take the form of a human, it is most often either in the form of a young woman to trick young men into coming near so it can drown them or as a large hairy person to drag travelers into the water.</p>

            <p>There is one story of a kelpie that doesn’t involve it drowning its victims. According to this story, a man near Peterhead, found a kelpie. Knowing what the creature was, he carefully put a bridle on the creature, which is said to be the only way to subdue a kelpie. After the kelpie was successfully subdued, he used the kelpie to build a bridge nearby. After the bridge was complete, he set the kelpie free. He then used the story about the kelpie’s hard work if his sons ever complained about their work. However, it should be noted that this story is an exception as most don’t end well for the person who encountered the kelpie.</p>

            <p>Interestingly, there are also stories of a powerful kelpie in Loch Ness showing that people across time thought that Loch Ness contained a monster, even if the idea of the past was very different from the cryptid that some people think lives there.</p>

            <p>There are also two giant horse head statues in Scotland along the river between the towns of Falkirk and Grangemouth that are called the Kelpies after the myth.</p>
