            <p>Celtic Mythology is not talked about in the same way that Greek or Nordic Mythology is. While Greek and Nordic characters can be found in big movies like in the Avengers movies or in Wonder Woman or whose influence can be seen in books like the Percy Jackson series or in the Dwarves of Lord of the Rings, Celtic mythological is rarely presented in movies or books, especially well known movies and books.</p>

        <h3>Irish Mythology</h3>
            <p>Irish Mythology is Celtic Myths from Ireland and is probably the most well known. In Irish Myth, there are four different cycles:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The Mythological Cycle: involves stories of how the Irish gods called the Tuatha Dé Danann arrived in Ireland, stories of their time in Ireland including their fights with the Fomhoire, and how the Irish arrived in Ireland</li>
                    <li>The Fenian Cycle: centers around the hero <a href="final_fionn_mac_cumhaill.html">Fionn mac Cumhaill</a> and the Fianna, a group of warriors Fionn leads</li>
                    <li>The Ulster Cycle: centers around the province of Ulster and the hero <a href="final_cu_chullainn.html">Cú Chulainn</a> </li>
                    <li>The Historical Cycle: stories about kings of Ireland that are a mix of history and myth</li>
                </ol>
            <img src="Assets/Fionn_mac_Cumhaill1.jpg" />
          <p>Irish Mythology also has some unusual stories in it. One example is the story of the first people to reach Ireland who only had three men and over a hundred women survive the journey, with two of the men dying soon after and the final man turning into a salmon that lives for at least hundreds of years called the Salmon of Knowledge, with the transformation never being explained.</p>

            <p>Celtic myths are under utilized by writers and have many interesting stories to tell. Hopefully, hearing some of the interesting creatures, characters, and stories from these myths will convince more people to look at and utilize them in their own stories.</p>
